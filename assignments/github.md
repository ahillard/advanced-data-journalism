Github assignment
=================

This short assignment will test your newfound knowledge of Github, while at the same time making sure some key tools on your machines work properly for the next phase of class.

It shouldn't take much time, but it has several steps:

  1. If you haven't already, be sure you've installed all of the software outlined in the [course requirements guide](https://gist.github.com/cjdd3b/5c5aa56153b7ca79b5d23f2fa38ae234).

  2. Create a [Github account](https://github.com/join).

  3. Create a new repository called `j4462-assignments-NAME` where NAME is your first name

  4. Clone the repository to your local machine. It's probably easiest to do this on your Desktop. We haven't covered how to navigate to the Desktop yet, but if you're using a Mac, open your terminal and type `cd Desktop` and then run the clone command from there.

  5. Create a new text or Markdown file called github.txt or github.md, respectively.

  6. Inside that file, write a couple paragraphs based on the instructions below.

  7. Check in your file and push it to your repository. That's it!

In terms of what you should write in the file, we'd like you to explore the Github portfolios of several prominent news organizations and pick out a project that looks interesting to you. Don't worry if you don't understand the code or the jargon. The goal here is to see the scope of the work that cutting-edge news organizations are doing with their technology.

Once you see a project that looks interesting, write up one or two paragraphs explaining why you chose it and what kind of questions you might have for the people who built it. Add that to the file in your repository and check it in.

Examples of news organizations' Github accounts include:

  - [The New York Times](https://github.com/newsdev)
  - [NPR Visuals](https://github.com/nprapps)
  - [ProPublica](https://github.com/propublica)
  - [The Los Angeles Times](https://github.com/datadesk)
  - [The Washington Post](https://github.com/datanews)
  - [The Texas Tribune](https://github.com/texastribune)
  - [WNYC](https://github.com/datanews)
  - [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight)
  - [St. Louis Post-Dispatch](https://github.com/PostDispatchInteractive)
  - [Chicago Tribune](https://github.com/newsapps)

This assignment is due **next Wednesday, Sept. 14**.
